# Development

## NodeJs

We recommend using Node Version Manager that we can consistently align versions.

```
# On the first time
nvm install
# On subsequent times
nvm use
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm run build`

It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance in the `build` folder.

A varient `npm run build:prod` is also available which is going to override the `.env` file with the values from a `.env-prod`.

## `npm run deploy`

Intended to be used after `npm run build:prod`.
It deploys the content from the `/build` folder to: https://rafacandev.github.io/twilio-sms-web/

## Environment Variables

This project uses [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to manage environment variables.
Developers can change these values according to their needs via environment variables or editing the `.env` file.

Sample `.env` file:

```
REPLY_MESSAGE
API_TOKEN
ALLOWED_HOST
TWILIO_ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBER
SYNOLOGY_SSO_URL
SYNOLOGY_SSO_APP_ID
COOKIE_SECRET

# Include your authentication info
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_API_TOKEN=SKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_API_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

`.env` files should be managed independently and they should not be pushed to the codebase repository.
